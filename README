Using BitHorde
==============

At this stage, bithorde is still at an alpha stage. Tread lightly, and beware of
gremlins.

That said, copy the example config, modify to your hearts desires, and start bithorded.
After that, you can use bhupload and bhget to upload/fetch from BitHorde, and bhfuse to
mount BitHorde to a given mountpoint, for other applications to gain direct access.

Building BitHorde
=================

BitHorde is written in C++ using the boost libraries, and is using CMake for build
management. BitHorde is currently only tested for Linux (will possibly work on other
POSIX-systems).

Build requirements (Ubuntu Package Names)

  cmake
  libboost1.48-all-dev
  libcrypto++-dev
  libfuse-dev
  libprotobuf-dev
  pkg-config
  protobuf-compiler

Testing requirements (only required for running the test-suite)

  python-crypto
  python-protobuf

With all dependencies installed, building should be as simple as:

::

  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make

The test-suite can be run from the build-directory using ctest:

::

  ctest

Good Luck, and don't hesitate to ask around if you encounter problems.
