Using BitHorde
==============

At this stage, bithorde is still at an alpha stage. Tread lightly, and beware of 
gremlins.

That said, copy the example config, modify to your hearts desires, and start bithorded.
After that, you can use bhupload and bhget to upload/fetch from BitHorde, and bhfuse to
mount BitHorde to a given mountpoint, for other applications to gain direct access.

Building BitHorde
=================

BitHorde is written in D using the Tango stdlib, and is using CMake for build management.
BitHorde is currently only tested for Linux (will possibly work on other POSIX-systems).
Once libtango, a d-compiler (LDC suggested), make and cmake is installed, something
like this should do;

::

  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make

Good Luck, and don't hesitate to ask around if you encounter problems.
